# BankStatementDashboard
The goal is have an interactive finance dashboard that helps me achieve my finanical goals. The project at the moment is to have an historical tab which shows analytics on transactions from 2014 to display how my spending patterns have changed or other insights that may be interesting. The second tab is the budget manager which will allow me to categorize transactions, set categorized budgets and have analytics. The end goal is have a smart assistant to suggest alternatives for my purchases, for example, it should recognize a regular coffee purchase from Starbucks then it may suggest a alternative cheaper yet upholding review standards option like McDonald's coffee. The AI assistant will in a separate repo once created so it can be modified and reused by other applications.
